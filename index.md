### [Writing Wb Apps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BBUimtgX2wfDuOsCWwzSZh5-G3OT0FzPS5Ma7bC-voI/edit)
### [Korero](https://bwedgar.github.io/korero) A web app for learning Te Reo.
### [Push To Telescope](https://bwedgar.github.io/PushToTelescope) A web app for finding celestial objects using a Dobsonian mounted Telescope
### [Slide Show](https://bwedgar.github.io/slideshow) A web app that will make a slide show of photos from the photo folder and allow Spotify to play while the iphone is mirrored to a TV.
## Coding sounds
I became interesting in making sounds using code in 2019.  This was mainly motivated with using a web app to control my model railway using audio modulated infrared signals.  It occurred to me that audio effects could be made by the same web app.
### Bird Songs
Birdsongs are analysed and reproduced using Web Audio API [Coding Bird Songs](birdsongs.md).
### Sound effects
I am writing a [web app](soundeffects.md) to make sound effects for my model railway.  These ideas are based on [go](https://noisehack.com/generate-noise-web-audio-api)
### WebAudio test
This is a way of testing if a device can use Web Audio API. [test](https://bwedgar.github.io/WebAudioTest)
### Synthetic Māori voice.
I have written mespeakmaori.js to change written māori language into spoken māori.  I use the formant synthesiser at [mespeak](https://www.masswerk.at/mespeak/) with code to produce the necessary phonemes and stressed syllables.  I did not use the option of coding a voice as I could not understand how to do this. This is part of my korero web app and can also be accessed at [mespeakmaori](https://bwedgar.github.io/mespeakmaori)

## Web Apps
#### [Push To Telescope](https://bwedgar.github.io/PushToTelescope)
#### [Instructions](pushToTelescope.md)

## 3D Printing
I use a MakerBot Replicator 2 no to print models. I create my objects using code written with [OpenScad](http://www.openscad.org/). I keep my OpenScad code on my OpenScad repository on GitHub.  I share my objects on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/bwedgar/designs).

## Electronics
I have been interested in electronics since childhood when I got a [Phillips electronics set](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TII3Z-jXk).
### Picaxe
I use Picaxe microprocessors. These come in various sizes from 8 legs to many more. They are programmed in BASIC from a PC.  
My picaxe programs are in GitHub repo [Picaxe](picaxe.md).
#### Model Rail Frame Controller
This takes input from a smart device and controls engines, lights, mechanical devices.
#### Infrared Serial Data Transmitter Web app
This web app allows a computer or mobile device to send serial signals to a picaxe computer (or Sony TV). It is based on a circuit by ???.  [Run the Web App](https://bwedgar.github.io/InfraRedSerialTransmitter)
