###  Writing and storing code
After too many times of losing code I started using GitHub to store versions.  I write code using the Atom editor.  I use GitHub Desktop rather than command line instructions.
### Web apps
I code web apps using HTML5 Javascript and CSS.  I used JQuery and JQuery Mobile until 2018 but found they did not work well for apps accessed straight from GitHub using "htmlpreview.github.io".  They also do not seem to be so necessary given the changes in Javasricpt and HTML.
