## Coding
###  Writing and storing code using github
After too many times of losing code I started using GitHub to store versions.  I write code using the Atom editor.  I use GitHub Desktop rather than command line instructions. I am writng my own [guide](github.md) to how GitHub works.
I have the CodeHub app on my iPhone which lets me edit any GitHub file away from my computer.
### Writing Web apps
I code web apps using HTML5 Javascript and CSS.  I used JQuery and JQuery Mobile until 2018 but found they did not work well for apps accessed straight from GitHub using "htmlpreview.github.io".   Also I used coffeescript up to 2018 but the ES6 version of Javascript seems to provide the same functions. They also do not seem to be so necessary given the changes in Javasricpt and HTML.

## Astronomy
### My Telescope
I bought a short focus 6 inch equatorial mounted telescope around 1995 when I was less informed about telescopes than I am now. I found this hard to move around with its heavy mechanism and tripod and hard to get a comfortable viewing angle. I then modified the mount to make an alt-az mounting as I had no need to track stars or use the setting circles to find stars. This made it easier to use but still not very portable; I did not use it much. Lately I got rid of the tripod and gearing by building a dobsonian mounting. I had some formica offcuts from a bench I had made, some 18 mm plywood left over from building and some teflon blocks I had got from a plastics shop years ago. I used the excellent instructions on the [Stellafane site](https://stellafane.org/tm/dob/index.html). The finished product exceeded my expectations. It is easy to use and I expect to spend more time with my telescope.  [photo](img)

## Model Making
### Model Rail
I had a 4x8 foot table top train set from Triang when I was a child. It must have been their [TT scale](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TT_scale). My grandparents had an old [Lionel train set](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Corporation). The three rail system gave a painful shock! I would set this up on the carpet of their downstairs room and had many happy days surrounded by the heady fumes of “carbon tet”.

I have been an “armchair modeller” for many years. In October 2017 I bought some [angle brace](http://www.miteknz.co.nz/Products/LUMBERLOK-Timber-Connectors/Bracing-Products/Angle-Brace/) to make a frame. I only put it together in February 2019.
The aim is to have all the electronics, lighting and mechanical parts in the frame and have several models that can fit in the frame, so saving space and allowing different scenery.
I also plan to 3D print my engines and rolling stock. This suggest using battery powered engines.

## 3D Printing
I use a MakerBot Replicator 2 to print models. I create my objects using code written with [OpenScad](http://www.openscad.org/). I keep my OpenScad code on my OpenScad repository on github.  I share my objects on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/bwedgar/designs).

## Electronics
I have been interested in electronics since childhood when I got a [Phillips electronics set](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TII3Z-jXk). I use Picaxe microprocessors.

## Web site
I write this site using the [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown) provided by GitHub. This allows links, content and formatting without having to write HTML tags. So much easier.
