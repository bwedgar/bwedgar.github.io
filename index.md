## Model Making
### Model Rail
I had a 4x8 foot table top train set from Triang when I was a child. It must have been their [TT scale](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TT_scale). My grandparents had an old [Lionel train set](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Corporation). The three rail system gave a painful shock! I would set this up on the carpet of their downstairs room and had many happy days surrounded by the heady fumes of “carbon tet”.

I have been an “armchair modeller” for many years. In October 2017 I bought some [angle brace](http://www.miteknz.co.nz/Products/LUMBERLOK-Timber-Connectors/Bracing-Products/Angle-Brace/) to make a frame. I only put it together in February 2019. 
The aim is to have all the electronics, lighting and mechanical parts in the frame and have several models that can fit in the frame, so saving space and allowing different scenery. 
I also plan to 3D print my engines and rolling stock. This suggest using battery powered engines.

#### Models
## 3D Printing
I use a MakerBot Replicator 2 to print models. I create my objects using code written with [OpenScad](http://www.openscad.org/). I share my objects on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/bwedgar/designs). 

## Electronics
I have been interested in electronics since childhood when I got a [Phillips electronics set](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TII3Z-jXk). I use Picaxe microprocessors.

## Coding
###  Writing and storing code
After too many times of losing code I started using GitHub to store versions.  I write code using the Atom editor.  I use GitHub Desktop rather than command line instructions.
I have the CodeHub app on my iPhone which lets me edit any GitHub file away from my computer. 
### Web apps
I code web apps using HTML5 Javascript and CSS.  I used JQuery and JQuery Mobile until 2018 but found they did not work well for apps accessed straight from GitHub using "htmlpreview.github.io".   Also I used coffeescript up to 2018 but the ES6 version of Javascript seems to provide the same functions. They also do not seem to be so necessary given the changes in Javasricpt and HTML.
## Web site
I write this site using the markdown provided by GitHub called [Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html). This allows links, content and formatting without having to write HTML tags. So much easier.
