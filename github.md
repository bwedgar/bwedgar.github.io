# My guide to understanding and using GitHub
## Versions
Github takes a file that you create on your computer, or a file you create using the online editor at github.com.
When you have written the file on the computer you go to GitDeskTop app and press the blue Commit to button, then the blue Push button
This sends the file to GitHub as a version. 

# Using online GitHub
This has the advantage of giving you access to all the functions you need to make and maintain your github web site. When you add or edit a file it is available after a minute to run the code off the web. It has the disadvantage of no code formating and a small delay between comitting a file and running it.
