### navigation
      The button will calibrate the app. Get an object, usially a bright star in the eye piece and press the button. 
      This should be done as you move around the sky.
      The target bars show where the telescope is pointed. The top bar shows the altitude (angle above the horizon); lift or lower this to centre the cursor
      The lower bar shows the azimuth or compass bearing. Rotate the telescope to get the cursor in the target circle.
      The grey circle and line shows the position of the object in our galaxy. The red cross is the sun, the dot is the object.
      The object selector buttons at the bottom of the screen let you find an object to observe.
      The screens are rendered in red on black to preserve night vision.
#### Selector Buttons
      The codes are:
     
     B Bright Stars. These are stars which are used for calibrating the telescope. They are all within 3000 lightyears of us and so will not show on the galaxy model.
     D Double (and other interesting) stars. Most stars in the galaxy are double or muliple stars.
  N  Bright Nebulas are areas of star creation.
  R  Remnants
O  Open Clusters are groups of up to 1000 stars. They are all formed together from a Giant Molecular Cloud and stay together, orbiting the galaxy centre in the galactic disc until they collide with another object and move apart. They last
      for 100 or 1000 million years.
    G Globular Clusters are groups of millions of stars above and below the galactic disk.
  X Galaxies. These are very distant groups of billions of stars.
####  Naming objects
#### Object Lists
      The objects are greyed out if they are less than 15 degrees above the horizon and so cannot be seen well.
    
###  Installing
      The device the app is running on needs to be mounted at 45 degrees to the long axis of the telescope.
###  About
      The web app was written by Brian Edgar in 2018. It contains code from others for which I am grateful that it was shared and this is acknowledge in the code. The data base of objects was cut from various places on the web and pasted into a
      spreadsheet
      which is read by the app. I will update this as I discover more objects to look at.
